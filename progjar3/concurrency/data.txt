Project Plan 
for
<project name>





Distribution: 
<Organization., Name>

Appendices: 
<Appendix 1>


Help:	The purpose of the Project Plan is to document all managerial aspects of a project that are required to execute it successfully within its constraints. If some aspects are defined in separate plans (e.g. Quality Assurance Plan, Configuration Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, Project Schedule), the Project Plan should refer to these documents.
It is important, that also non-applicability of a section is agreed on by the responsible manager. Therefore:
•	Don’t remove headlines level 1 and level 2 headlines (Heading1 and Heading2)
•	Reasons why a section is not applicable shall be documented under the respective headline

•	Functional goals
•	Strategic goals
•	Business goals (e.g.: time-to-market, cost)
•	Technological goals
•	Quality goals
•	Organizational goals (e.g. competence development, testing of new methods, techniques, or tools, application of new processes, etc.)
•	Other goals, e.g.: usability, portability, etc. (these goals, and what is specifically expected, should be clearly specified in the Project Requirements Specification)
•	Constraints (e.g.: environmental constraints, application specific standards, national standards, cultural relationships, etc.)

Prioritize the project goals: 
Functional, business, and quality goals should be prioritized at least.

5. Risk Management
Help:	Describe the procedure to be used for managing risks in the project. The procedure should specify who is responsible for risk management, when risk situation is regularly considered (e.g. at each project status meeting), and which roles risks are communicated to, etc.
Also refer to the Risk Management Plan (or Risk Sheet) where the risks are listed, assessed, and mitigation and contingency is defined. 
Example:

All identified risks are documented, assessed and prioritized in the Risk Management Plan [5] by the Project manager. The plan also defines the mitigation and contingency measures and who is responsible for. The Risk Management Plan is updated monthly or on event and communicated to all affected stakeholders by the Project Manager. The risk status is reported to the line management in the monthly Project Report.

6. Sub-contract Management
Help:	List which part of work is out-sourced to which sub-contractor.
Refer to the sub-contractor’s agreement that should include or refer to the statement of work, the execution process, milestones, quality assurance, configuration management, communication structure, hand-over procedure, acceptance criteria, and quality audits.
